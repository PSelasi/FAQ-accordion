## FAQ-accordion
A basic FAQ section where questions expand to show answers when clicked. Built with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no fancy frameworks needed.  

## How It Works  
- **Questions** are buttons you can click  
- **Answers** slide open smoothly when selected    
- Works on phones and computers  

## What's Included  
1. **HTML file** - Contains all the questions/answers  
2. **CSS file** - Makes it look nice with animations  
3. **JavaScript file** - Handles the opening/closing  

## Browser Support  
Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Might need small tweaks for really old browsers.
